      <h3>Anas Hashim</h3>
      <p>Hi, My name is Anas and i am a Computer Science student. I have previously completed many projects in python and java in which i have developed my skills in these programming languages by using the skills that ibeen taught or picked up by myself or with teachers. This has helped expand my knowledge on these languages to utilise this knowledge for future bigger projects that may arise.
        
      In my spare time, i have an avid interest for sports whether that be playing or watching it. Sports such as Football, Basketball and American Football have been a big part of my life and gives me an avenue to enjoy and destress from studies. The crypto and the stock market is a fun place to indulge in, as it has very interesting news that comes from it every day which intices me. Moreover, watching and playing video games was the main spark in the reason i chose computer sciences and acts as a catalyst for me to code in the programming languages the university has to offer.</p>

    <h3>Java Project: DragonBallPixelZ</h3>
    <p>
	With this Java project, i wanted to aim to make a platform shooter, in which games such as Super Smash Bros, and Dragon Ball had inspired me to transfer that idea and try replicate it in the world of Java. My plan was to try and execute something similar by implementing two characters with two users being able to play. With this theme, comes different playable maps in which i tried to have a somewhat large pool in the 5 maps that can be selected by the user. There are many features included within this, such as lives, gems (dragonball) and platforms to make this game a fun and exciting experience for the users to battle it out against each other. With the java project comes a graphical user interface to make it more of a realistic game with options on the menu for the users to interact with. Ultimately, the game reflects my passions in playing these games and to attempt to make a game with such features from these brilliantly polished games.
